Library Management System – Code Review Report
This project implements a simple library management system with support for adding books, issuing and returning them, searching, and storing data in a JSON catalog. The system is divided into two main components: Book and LibraryInventory.

Book Class
The Book class is well-designed and uses dataclasses for clean initialization. It normalizes input values and ensures valid status states. Methods for issuing and returning a book work correctly, and the class provides both string representation and dictionary conversion for easy JSON storage.

LibraryInventory Class
The inventory class loads and saves book data reliably using JSON. It handles missing or corrupt files gracefully and prevents duplicate ISBNs. Search functionality by title and ISBN is implemented correctly, and methods for issuing and returning books update the catalog accurately.

CLI Functionality
The program includes a simple menu-driven interface that lets users add books, search, issue, return, and view all items. Input validation is handled well, and the catalog is saved after all relevant actions.

Overall Assessment
The system is functional, cleanly written, and logically structured. Minor improvements include separating CLI code into a dedicated main.py file and removing duplicate code. With these adjustments, the project becomes neatly modular and production-ready for small-scale use.
